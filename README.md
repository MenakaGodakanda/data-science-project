# Data Science Project

This project is part of the BCG Virtual Job Simulation offered by Forage and is for educational purposes only. The goal of this project is to analyse business-related data, extract meaningful insights through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), perform feature engineering, and develop a Random Forest Classifier to make predictions.
